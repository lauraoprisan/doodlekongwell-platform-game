## Short Description

This is a platform game and the goal is to go as high as possible without dying along the way by 
either falling into the lava or getting into the red half part of some platforms. The player can dash 
to try to reach platforms that are too far for a simple jump and it can also dash through the platforms that have a green half. After an offset time that lets the player familiarize with the move
ment, the lava is set to maintain a maximal distance between itself and  the player independently 
of how fast the player manages to go upwards. The game has a highscore system implemented.
